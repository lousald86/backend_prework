#Study Drills
#1- elsif if used if there needs to be a second conditional statement before the
#else statement. Else is used as a fall-back condition that should run if the
#initial if statement or if and elseif statements are not true/do not have their
#conditions met.
#2- Done!
#3- Done!
#4- Done!
